# goophy-python
3/9/2020 - Python/Selenium remake of Google image scrape back end.  No front end implemented.  Files saved to a local folder.  Modify variables to get different search terms or number of results.

( https://github.com/mtaur/goophy - Used JavaScript and Nightmare.io automated browser to scrape Google. See https://github.com/mtaur/goophypedia to see updated version that works as of 3/2020 update )
